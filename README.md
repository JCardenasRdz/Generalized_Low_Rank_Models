Learning and applying  Generalized_Low_Rank_Models

## Title
Using Generalized Low Rank models to deal with real-world data

### Summary
The goal of this workshop is to introduce Generalized Low Rank models (GLRMs) and how to implement them in Python / Julia.
GLRMs can recover many common dimensionality reduction (PCA, NNMF, etc); their goal is to create a numeric representation (X,Y) for tables (A) that simultaneously contain multiple types of data (boolean, categorical, numerical, ordinal, missing). We will discuss how to create such numerical representation, and how to use them.

### Pre-requisites ( ideal but not mandatory):
-	Matrix multiplication ( A = XY )
-	Understand what an objective function is ( think least squares)
-	Basic python programming
-	
### Proposed time:
- Wednesday May 19th, 2021 9:00 am to 10:00 AM
